# GrainPalette - A Deep Learning Odyssey in Rice Type Classification Through Transfer Learning

## 🌾 Domain
Artificial Intelligence / Deep Learning

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow & Keras
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2)
- Google Colab

## 🎯 Objective
To build an AI-powered rice type classification model that can accurately identify 5 types of rice grains (Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, Karacadag) using deep learning and transfer learning techniques. This solution aids farmers, scientists, and consumers in rice identification for agricultural decision-making.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Name:** Rice Image Dataset
- **Images:** 75,000+ across 5 classes
- **Preprocessing:** Resizing (224x224), normalization, augmentation

## 🧠 Model Architecture
- **Base:** MobileNetV2 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Custom Head:** GlobalAveragePooling + Dense(Softmax)
- **Optimizer:** RMSProp
- **Loss Function:** Categorical Crossentropy
- **Validation Accuracy:** ~96.4%

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy, Loss (visualized with matplotlib)
- Consistently >94% validation accuracy

## 🧪 Testing
- Real-time prediction from uploaded rice grain image
- Results displayed directly in Colab notebook

## 💾 Output Files
- `rice_classifier_model.keras` — Saved trained model
- `prediction_notebook.ipynb` — Colab notebook to predict from image

## 🚀 Deployment Ready
Can be deployed using:
- Streamlit or Gradio Web App
- TensorFlow Lite for Android
- Flask API for web integrations
